  <h3>Why Beyoncé?</h3>
  <h1>Why is Beyoncé the best?</h1>
  <p>It’s unusual for an artist to be so multi-talented. Beyonce is a globally famous, acclaimed vocalist while also being an incredible dancer, actress and performer.
    <br/><br/>
    Her concerts are well-known for their incredible spectacle - the sets, the choreography - and she sells out stadiums and arenas internationally. She has performed at presidential inaugurations and the Super Bowl. Beyonce has been at the peak of the music world for over 20 years and has always successfully reinvented herself, encompassing so many different genres like R&B, hip-hop, rock, country and blues.
<br/><br/>
She has sold over 200 million records and is the most-awarded female artist of all time. You can call her Queen Bey!</p>

              Hi! My name is Matt and I've been living in Lisbon for several
              years. I'm very fond of the Beyonce’s music. I created this page
              as part of a project for SheCodes Responsive to develop my coding
              skills.
